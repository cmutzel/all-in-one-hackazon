Best of all, these paints are spill-proof, with no mess at all. Each 5-inch bottle contains 2.5 ounces of paint in pink, violet, teal, yellow, green, or brown. The sponge tip creates a neat dot of paint about .5 inches wide, and the paint dries quickly so colors can be layered.

But only the Glide Thru Detangling Brush has firm, quality bristles that will not lose their shape!\r\nTHE BEST AT REMOVING KNOTS AND TANGLES - Ordinary brushes work against the hair, basically ripping through and pulling out the knotted hair instead of detangling it! But the unique cone shaped plastic bristles work to separate the hair sideways instead of down, gently unraveling even the toughest tangles.\r\nCHILD FRIENDLY - No more fits when it\'s time to get ready to go out! The Glide Thru brush doesn\'t dig into the scalp or rip out hair like other brushes. It takes out tangles without yanking or hurting. One customer review states, \"My daughter used to cry every time Mommy brushed her hair. This brush is the best thing I ever bought for her.\"\r\nLIFE CHANGING BRUSH - Other brushes have beads at the end that can dig into the scalp and cause pain and get caught in tangles. The Glide Thru brush has painless bristles that massage the scalp and increase circulation, which may help increase hair growth. One customer writes: \"I brushed my hair for at least 2 or 3 minutes because it felt so good.\" It also smoothes the cuticle layer, making your hair shine!\r\nLESS HAIR LOSS, LESS STRESS - No more ripping out hair just to get rid of tangles!

Organic Ghee is rich in nutrients, including healthy fat soluble vitamins which aid in the absorption of nutrients in the foods. Ghee contains naturally occurring CLA, Vitamins A, D & K. Per Ayurveda, cow ghee is one of the most sacred foods. During the clarification process, milk solids are removed, leaving the healthy butter fats behind. Small, trace amounts of casein and lactose can possibly remain in the ghee, but unless a person is extremely sensitive, consuming ghee will be fine, even if dairy is not. Ghee does not contain milk solids, which gives it a very high smoke point (~485 °F). Because it is very stable at high heat, it is considered one of the best oils for baking, sautéing and deep fat frying. When you sauté or fry with butter, milk solids can burn causing an unpleasant odor, appearance and taste. Also, there is no hissing, popping or splattering when you use ghee. It also has a sweet aroma and actually becomes richer in flavor as well. Ghee does not contain harmful trans-fats which can cause heart disease and many other serious health problems. Well-prepared ghee is very shelf-stable because it has low moisture content. Keep in an airtight container at room temperature for 2-3 months. In the refrigerator, it can last up to a year.\r\n',0,12.95,'Grassfed_Organic_Ghee_7_8_Oz_Pure_Indian_Foods_R_Brand_small_20581b.jpg',NULL,NULL,0,0,'Grassfed_Organic_Ghee_7_8_Oz_Pure_Indian_Foods_R_Brand_big_c5ddc0.jpg',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,1,NULL),(78,19,'\r\nHall\'s Chocolate Fudge, 1 Pound\r\n','\r\nHall\'s Candies smooth and creamy original recipe Chocolate Fudge is guaranteed to leave you smiling and wanting more!

Vita Coco is never made from concentrate. That means we pick, crack, and pack fresh young coconuts directly at the source. After the coconuts are cleaned, the delicate water inside is flash pasteurized (and occasionally mixed with all-natural fruit puree) then poured into a shelf-stable Tetra Pak.

This is quickly becoming my favorite RPG on the Vita!\n\nWhile there are a ton of JRPGs on the Vita, not many offer this level of character customization. OK, so you can	 really pick the main characters race (hes human), gender (well, technically you can be female, but NPCs will refer to you as male regardless), or class (though the unique \"Gazer\" class of the main character can be developed pretty much like a warrior, mage, healer, or whatever you like)...but you get a lot of options for rounding out your party. You are not limited to taking the recommended party members, and can build your party however you want. You can have 4 teammates of whatever class you want. Want to rely on healing items and skip a designated healer class character? Sure. Want a bunch of deadly, light armored Samurai and Assassins with a healer to protect, buff, and revive them when they do get hit? Its all up to you!\n\nYou can pick race, gender, and class for your party members, and even get to choose from a limited set of voice sounds as well as the character portrait. Be advised, the portraits (and in fact much of the game play) follows the standard JRPG format of scantily clad ladies and slightly risque situations (in addition to standard armor, you can equip/upgrade the characters \"undies\"). I think its totally harmless (and no where near as nauseatingly over-sexualized as games like Dragons Crown), but some may be put off.\n\nThe artwork of the stills is quite nice, and its a shame the battle sequences aren	 fully animated...its decidedly old school and reminds me a bit of games like Phantasy Star. Still, being able to build your party as youd like, equip them with multiple weapons sets that can be switched in combat (to allow melee/ranged attacks if youd like), and the twists with game play such as unlocking the \"demon\" mechanic or equipping artifacts that bestow the abilities of other classes, add enough complexity and strategic sophistication to really make the game engrossing.\n\nThis game is by no means perfect, and doesn	 really break much new ground, but is well put together with fun and challenging game play. While save points are frequent enough to allow pick up/put down gaming (ideal on the Vita), Ive found myself happily sinking a few hours at a time tweaking my characters, selling/stockpiling items, and exploring the many challenging dungeons.','2014-07-28 02:57:50',0,4),(344,25,'CTChuck','eml343_ctchuck@example.com','These are great, but its sometimes difficult to install correctly; so I always ask the store to install it.','2014-07-28 02:57:40',0,5),(345,10,'Tommy2009','eml344_tommy2009@example.com','David Gray is a highly under rated artist.
